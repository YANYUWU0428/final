## Paper Overview
In this study, we analyzed the shooting incidents in the city of Toronto using publicly accessible data. We conducted a time series analysis to identify patterns over time. Our analysis showed that shooting fatality and injury rates were consistently higher during certain time periods. In addition, predictive modeling showed an upward trend in these incidents. These insights are critical for developing strategic law enforcement measures to reduce the incidence of urban shooting fatalities and injuries. These measures are expected to enhance community safety and increase public awareness of safety.
